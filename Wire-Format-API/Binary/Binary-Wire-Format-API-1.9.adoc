=== Goals

The Binary Wire Format API is a binary one to one translation of the Text format.

WFA is designed to be high level description for Wire Formats to comply with.  Any Wire Format which complies with this RFC can be accessed through the same API.

This format should be automatically translatable to the Text (human readable) format.

=== Encoding Byte

For short fields, the first byte denotes the type of the field, for small numbers the value is encoded in the later 4 bits. For strings and fields the later 4 bits denote the length of the preceeding data. For large numerics or string/fields the special type is used see section below :

| top three bits denotes a three Type   | x   | x   | x   |  x  |     |     |     |

==== Definition of a field and a string

In the following uri

[source, yaml]
csp: //a-uri?view=map

'csp' is the Field. 

And '//a-uri?view=map' is the String 

=== Types ( for larger values )

the types use the Control Messages

Version 1.6 added 0xBD

===  Sequences, Maps and Marshallables

the sequence area encoded using 

[source]
0x82 <four byte unsigned len, this is the length in bytes of the encoded block of preceding data>

so if we were going to encode these simple 4 entries ( shown below in text yaml )

[source]
[a,b,c,de]

 As binary wire this would encode to 

[source]
0x82 0x09 0x00 0x00 0x00 0xE1 0x61 0xE1 0x62 0xE1 0x63 0xE2 0x64 0x65

|===
| byte | description 
| 0x82 | denoting a nested structure  
| 0x09 0x00 0x00 0x00 | the number of bytes of data to follow ( in little endian ) 
| 0xE1 | next element is a string of len 1 
| 0x61 | 'a' 
| 0xE1 | next element is a string of len 1 
| 0x62 | 'b' 
| 0xE1 | next element is a string of len 1 
| 0x63 | 'c' 
| 0xE2 | next element is a string of len 2 
| 0x64 0x65 | 'de' 
|===

NOTE: although YAML treats sequences and maps differently, for binary wire we use similar encoding, its just they will hold different information

[source, yaml]
{f1: a, f2: de}

as binary wire this would encode to 

[source]
0x82 0x0B 0x00 0x00 0x00 0xC2 0x66 0x31 0xE1 0x62 0xC2 0x66 0x32 0xE2 0x64 0x65

|===
| byte | description 
| 0x82 | denoting a nested structure 
| 0x0B 0x00 0x00 0x00 | the number of bytes of data to follow ( in little endian ) 
| 0xC2 |  next element is a field of len 2 
| 0x66 0x31 | 'f1' 
| 0xE1 | next element is a string of len 1 
| 0x62 | 'b' 
| 0xC2 | next element is a field of len 2 
| 0x66 0x32 | 'f2' 
| 0xE2 | next element is a string of len 2 
| 0x64 0x65 | 'de' 
|===

== Example

using this encoding described above, the following YAML

[source, yaml]
----
--- !!meta-data
csp: //path/service
tid: 123456789
--- !!data
entrySet: [
    {
    key: key-1,
    value: value-1
},
    {
    key: key-2,
    value: value-2
}
]
----

When encoded with BinaryWire would appear as:

[source]
00000000 1C 00 00 40 C3 63 73 70  EE 2F 2F 70 61 74 68 2F ···@·csp ·//path/

this is the java code that created this this binary output above 

[source, java]
----
@Test
public void testSequence() {
    Wire wire = createWire();
    writeMessage(wire);
    wire.flip();
    System.out.println(wire.bytes().toHexString());

    Wire twire = new TextWire(Bytes.elasticByteBuffer());
    writeMessage(twire);
    twire.flip();
    System.out.println(Wires.fromSizePrefixedBlobs(twire.bytes()));
}

private void writeMessage(Wire wire) {
    wire.writeDocument(true, w -> w
            .write("csp").text("//path/service")
            .write("tid").int64(123456789));
    wire.writeDocument(false, w -> w
            .write("entrySet").sequence(s -> {
                s.marshallable(m -> m
                        .write("key").text("key-1")
                        .write("value").text("value-1"));
                s.marshallable(m -> m
                        .write("key").text("key-2")
                        .write("value").text("value-2"));
            }));
}
----

=== Layout

The expected format is

- 4 bytes length with the meta-data bit set.
- 3-byte field + "csp"
- N-byte string + string
- 3-bytes field + "tid"
- integer value as a int64.

In the future we will make the tid to be smaller. possibly just a byte or 3 (uint16).

Q.Where would the nested be involved? 

A.You might consider the whole document with its length a "nested" structure.
