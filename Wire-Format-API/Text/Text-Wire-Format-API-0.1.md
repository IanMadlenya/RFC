# Goals
The Text WFA is a text WFA format based a sub-set of the YAML format.  It is expected that any library which can read YAML can read this text format.

WFA is designed to be high level description for Wire Formats to comply with.  Any Wire Format which complies with this RFC can be accessed through the same API.

This format should be automatically translatable to the Binary format.

# Schema changes
The Text WFA should be able to handle all schema changes in the WFA document.

# Atomic Operations
YAML doesn't define a field type which is suitable as for atomic operations.  For this reason a composite type is needed which supports locking.

Note: this is expected to be dramatically slower than the same operation on a binary format.

## Atomic Int (32-bit)
```
!!atomic { locked: false, value: 0123456789 }
```
To read or write this value, first the lock must be obtained by CAS on the `locked:` field. Note: this cannot change the length of the entry.
```
!!atomic { locked:  true, value: 0123456789 }
```
Once the lock is held the value can be read and optionally updated with a suitable level of padding.
Finally the lock must be released with a CAS.

## Atomic Long (64-bit)
```
!!atomic { locked: false, value: 01234567890123456789 }
```
To read or write this value, first the lock must be obtained by CAS on the `locked:` field. Note: this cannot change the length of the entry.
```
!!atomic { locked:  true, value: 01234567890123456789 }
```
Once the lock is held the value can be read and optionally updated with a suitable level of padding.
Finally the lock must be released with a CAS.

## Snappy Compression
```
!!snappy KgB4ogEA
```
Any value contained in a !!snappy field is assumed to be compressed using the Snappy algorithm and then encoded using Base64.
